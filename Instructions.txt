Sure, here is a summary of the Bones dice game rules:

The goal of the game is to be the first player to reach 10,000 points.
To start, each player rolls one die. The player with the highest roll goes first.
On your turn, you roll all five dice. You can keep rolling as long as you roll at least one 1, 5, or three-of-a-kind.
If you roll a zero on your first roll, your turn is over and you lose all points from your previous roll.
You can score points for:
Ones: 100 points for each 1 rolled
Fives: 50 points for each 5 rolled
Three of a kind: 1000 points for three dice of the same number
Four of a kind: 2000 points for four dice of the same number
Yahtzee: 10,000 points for all five dice of the same number
You can also score bonus points for:
Full house: 200 points for three of one number and two of another number
Small straight: 300 points for 1-2-3-4-5
Large straight: 400 points for 2-3-4-5-6
If you end your turn without scoring any points, you lose all points from your previous roll.
The first player to reach 10,000 points wins.
Here are some additional tips for playing Bones:

Set a minimum score for yourself. This will help you avoid ending your turn with a low score.
Be strategic about when to keep rolling. If you have a good chance of scoring points, keep rolling. But if you're not sure, it's often better to end your turn and save your points.
Pay attention to the scoring guide. This will help you maximize your points.
Have fun! Bones is a fun and challenging game that can be enjoyed by people of all ages.
